# About Me

I am completing my engineering degree at [Mines Saint-Étienne](https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/) in France, specializing in formal methods and software security. I am interested in programming languages, static analysis, and the verification of software and hardware, and I enjoy both building tools and exploring their theoretical foundations.

In 2025, I gained my first research experience at [CEA](https://www.cea.fr/) through work on [Frama-C](https://frama-c.com/), where I developed a live debugger for abstract interpretation analyses. Earlier, I worked on kernel fuzzing tools, which strengthened my interest in low-level systems and software security.

I am interested in automated theorem proving and aim to complete the entire [*Software Foundations*](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/) series. I am also eager to contribute to projects in Rust and experiment with hardware description languages.

I am currently seeking an end-of-studies research internship starting in April 2026, with the goal of pursuing a PhD in formal methods.
